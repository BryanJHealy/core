	<!-- The detectors after a split will begin at pos="0" because it is a "new" edge. By using endPos="-1", we are telling SUMO to go right 1 meter away from the end position. The only reason the first three detectors in this file don't use this connotation is STRICTLY for demonstration purposes of being able to still see the lane signal for the connection of the lanes at the intersection (arrows)-->
