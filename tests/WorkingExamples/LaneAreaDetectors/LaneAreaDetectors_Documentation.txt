This folder contains an example where lane area detectors are being used and the configuration of them is slightly confusing when dealing with a split in the road as previously documented in the LaneSplit example.

Depending on how you split the road will not change much about the detector definitions in the additional files (cross.add.xml). Please see the three pictures located in this folder to show the slight variations. The big difference is that the detector file starts with a 0 index no matter how many lanes there are.

Example (shown in pictures): We have the the lanes Left (L) and Center (C) but no Right (R) lane, and after the split, we have RCL. To place a lane area detector before the split, we will need to know the edge name (1i) and for placing in the center lane, we will use the tag: lane="1i_0" to get the detector in the center lane, as THIS IS THE RIGHT-MOST LANE for this edge, since the R lane is missing. For placing a detector in the L lane, we use the tag: lane="1i_1" as this is the second lane now. This is shown in the picture titled: "LaneAreaDetectors_01_012_splitright".

After the split and on the lanes that are closest to the intersection, denoting the lane is similar to that of how to denote the connections file (previously shown in LaneSplit example). To place the detector in the R lane (assuming we went from 2 to 3/all lanes), it will be: lane="1i.450_0" , the C lane will be lane="1i.450_1" , and the L lane will be: lane="1i.450_2" .

The last part that is difficult with detectors is the positioning of them. Because the splitting of the lanes doesn't just magically go from 2 to 3, i.e. there is some stretch of road that begins to expand the lanes to eventually get 3 lanes, some length is lost here when trying to describe the position. Our split happens at 450m from the start, and the intersection is at 500m from the start. However, the split lanes ARE NOT 50m. There is road lost to the intersection and to the split. This in turn makes the length of the split road around 30-35m. There WILL BE a compiling error if the lane area detector is not contained all on one edge (i.e. spills into the intersection/into the split). This means we will have some more investigative work to accomplish with figuring out the max lengths our detector areas will be.
